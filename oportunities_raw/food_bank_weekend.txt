Capitol Hill Food Bank needs weekend volunteers to greet neighbors, check them in, and assemble pantry boxes with fresh produce and staples. Shifts are Saturdays 9am-noon and include a brief orientation with our volunteer coordinator.

Ideal volunteers are upbeat, can lift 25 pounds, and enjoy friendly conversation while keeping the line running smoothly. Spanish or Vietnamese language skills are a bonus but not required.
