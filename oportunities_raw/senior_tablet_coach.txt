Redmond Senior Center hosts a drop-in tablet help bar every Tuesday afternoon for older adults navigating telehealth, messaging apps, and photo sharing. Volunteers sit one-on-one for 30-minute sessions, listening carefully and coaching at the learner's pace.

If you can explain tech without jargon, stay calm under repetitive questions, and document simple how-to cards, this role is for you. Training provided; masks required indoors.
