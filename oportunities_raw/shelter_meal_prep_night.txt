Hope Harbor Shelter runs a nightly dinner program for 48 residents and needs prep assistants 4-7pm. Duties include chopping produce, assembling salads, portioning hot trays, and tidying the kitchen afterward.

ServeSafe certification is welcome but not required; our kitchen manager provides a safety briefing at the start of each shift. Perfect for people who like fast-paced teamwork with a tangible impact.
