Seattle Youth Sports trains volunteer referees for our fall soccer league serving ages 8-12. Refs manage the flow of play, encourage good sportsmanship, and communicate with coaches about substitutions and safety.

Training clinic and rulebook provided; you just need reliable transportation to city fields on Saturday mornings. Modest mileage stipend available. Great for former players or parents who love the game.
