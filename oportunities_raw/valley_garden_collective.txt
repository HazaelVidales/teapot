Cascade Valley Garden Collective coordinates Thursday evening work parties at our half-acre donation garden. Volunteers weed, seed, build drip lines, and harvest produce that ships to neighborhood free fridges the next morning.

Expect dirt under your nails, time with pollinators, and shared snacks under the tool shed awning. No garden experience needed—team leads pair you with a task that matches your comfort level.
