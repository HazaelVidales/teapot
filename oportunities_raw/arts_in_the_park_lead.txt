Arts in the Park is recruiting volunteers to lead rotating creative stations—chalk murals, nature weaving, instrument petting zoo—during our Sunday family pop-ups. Each volunteer hosts a table, welcomes kids, restocks supplies, and tracks attendance.

Best fit for people who can project energy, manage small groups, and clean up glitter without complaint. Program runs rain or shine at rotating parks in the central district.
