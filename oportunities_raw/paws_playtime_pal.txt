PAWS North needs Playtime Pals to socialize shy cats and medium-energy dogs awaiting adoption. Volunteers rotate through kennel rounds, offering puzzle feeders, brushing, and short leashed walks in the courtyard.

We ask for one two-hour shift per week, with on-site behavior staff to support you. Comfortable closed-toe shoes required; training covers reading animal stress signals and logging progress notes.
