Regional Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster hosts quarterly kit-build days to assemble 1,000 home preparedness buckets. Volunteers form assembly lines to portion supplies, label instruction cards, and palletize finished kits for shipment to rural fire districts.

Shifts are 3 hours, indoors, and well organized—expect upbeat music, clear roles, and a safety huddle led by emergency managers. Light lifting required; steel-toe boots provided if you don't have your own.
