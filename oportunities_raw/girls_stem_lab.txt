Northside Community Center is launching a Saturday STEM lab for 6th-8th grade girls focused on robotics, circuitry, and creative problem solving. Mentors guide a cohort of eight students through hands-on builds, help them reflect on what worked, and celebrate small wins.

We provide lesson plans, kits, and staff support; you bring patience, curiosity, and confidence working with tweens. Background check required. Ideal volunteers can commit to at least four Saturdays from 10am-1pm.
