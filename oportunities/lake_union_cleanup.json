Volunteers meet at the Westlake kayak dock, receive gloves, grabbers, and safety instructions, then work in buddy teams for two hours.\n\nGreat for people who like light physical work outdoors and care about urban ecology. Kayak experience helps but is not required; we always need folks to sort debris and enter findings into our citizen science tracker.",
